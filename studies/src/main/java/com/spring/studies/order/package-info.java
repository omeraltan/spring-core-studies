/**
 *
 *      @Order
 *      1. The @Order annotation defines the sorting order of an annotated "component" or "bean".
 *      2. It has an optional value argument which determines the order of the component;
 *      the default value is Ordered.LOWEST_PRECEDENCE.
 *      3. This marks that the component has the lowest priority among all other ordered components.
 *      4. Similarly, the value Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE can be used for overriding the
 *      highest priority among components.
